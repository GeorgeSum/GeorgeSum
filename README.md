- âš¡ Fun fact: Japan has over 200 flavours of Kit Kats.
They're exclusively created for different regions, cities, and seasons. There are some tasty-sounding ones like banana, blueberry cheesecake and Oreo ice cream,
as well as some very questionable ones like baked potato, melon and cheese, wasabi, and vegetable juice.
